## What are we doing to achieve this goal?
With this wiki, we aim to centralize VEX IQ knowledge that often remains inaccessible to many. By making this project open-source, anyone can contribute to this wiki at any time. We are commited to creating an inclusive VEX IQ community, and we believe that this wiki well get us one step closer.
